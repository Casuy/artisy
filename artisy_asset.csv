ada3dace15444fe5af4f3ee738d3db69,Any Questions?,A 5533 Project by Nancy Atakan and Volkan Aslan,2014,https://www.artsy.net/artwork/a-5533-project-by-nancy-atakan-and-volkan-aslan-any-questions,,"""Any Questions?"" shows five people scribbling questions on a found blackboard retrieved from the storage area of the Istanbul art space, 5533. Sentences written on the board refer to the questions raised in different projects organized by the artist initiative over the last two years. The issues range from the binary of 'artist's initiative versus institution' to what defines periphery in Istanbul. In the video, the more actors come in and out of camera range and switch places to fill the board with their questions, the more illegible the questions become. This simple gesture opens up speculation about how the initiative works and the variable stance of artists, curators and even spectators who interact in the space. Actors include artists and curators who work with 5533 in 2014: Ali Taptık, Merve Ünsal, Nancy Atakan, Özden Demir, Özge Ersoy, and Volkan Aslan.

Birmelin,20th Century,https://www.artsy.net/artwork/robert-a-birmelin-4-animals,US$600,"Born in Newark, New Jersey, Robert Birmelin became a professor of fine arts at Queens College in New York, and is known for paintings that magnify through texture the realism of nature.
He earned his BA in 1956 and his MFA in 1960 from Yale School of Art and Architecture and also studied at Cooper Union and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. In 1960, he earned a Fulbright Scholarship, which took him to the Slade School of Art in London.
His work has been acquired by 40 public collections including New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Museum of Modern Art and Washington’s Hirshorn Museum. Among the various art magazines and journals where articles on Mr. Birmelin’s work have appeared are Art In America, American Artists, and Art Forum. Additionally, he has received numerous grants and awards from such organisations as The American Academy in Rome, The National Endowment for the Arts, The American Institute of Arts and Letters, and the Joan Mitchell Foundation.
From the 1970s to the mid-1990s, Mr. Birmelin found his principal inspiration in the streets of New York where he was fascinated by the energy and diversity of city life. His large paintings evoke movement, using focus and depth manipulations to suggest a close spatial and psychological relationship between the viewer and the world Birmelin has depicted. Hands often play an important role in these works, as exemplified by “The Twenty Dollars Bill.”
From 1993 to 2000, he became absorbed by memory, its unreliability and contradictions. These paintings are of states of mind, structured as a series of “reversible compositions,” which initially present a credible depiction of a place, and then after a moment, reveal insoluble contradictions created by contrasting opposing images of equal visual weight.
A new series of images of the life of the urban crowd was begun in 2001 and continues to the present. Many of these paintings have a sweeping sense of the choreography of masses of people in motion and reflect the tensions of contemporary urban reality.

Smith fabricates this process out of manmade materials, playing with the concepts of the natural and the man-made. She is known for creating her “urban geodes” either out of hand cut and folded paper or individually cast resin and configures them to seamlessly fit into public and private spaces that inspire her. The Box Geode was originally installed for the month of June 2012 at The Standard, Hollywood hotel and has since appeared in the 2015 campaign “Ladies First Since 1916” for Taylor Swift x Keds.

In her street work, Paige Smith draws inspiration from quiet, modest, tucked away spaces: the cracks in between bricks, the grating of a drain, the inside of a pipe and interior of a derelict phone booth. She creates her “urban geodes” either out of hand cut and folded die-cut paper or individually cast resin and configures them to seamlessly fit into spaces that inspire her—like a spirited mastermind cracking the code of a puzzle. Smith’s installations are like hidden gems sprinkled across the world that invite us to actually look, to be playful and discover and to participate in a glorious and global treasure hunt. Geodes are formations made and found in nature and the fact that Smith fabricates this process out of manmade materials and places them in major cities concurrently signals the tension between nature and industry and celebrates the beauty of urban space. Her work is infused with a magical realism that encourages us to pause, to discover, to be present and to find beauty in the mundane.

Johnston Limited. Geographers, Engravers and Printers, Edinburgh & London’ . English, circa 1890.
Brothers William Johnston (1802-1888) and Andrew Keith (1804-1871) began as apprentices to the leading Scottish globe-maker, James Kirkwood, until a fire destroyed his workshops in 1824. Setting out on their own, they acquired the established publishing house of William Lizars and began printing maps, atlases, gazetteers, guide books, globes and much more. Following their development of the first 12-inch geo-physical globe the Johnstons became the leaders of their field throughout Great Britain in the second half of the nineteenth century and were awarded a Royal Appointment by Queen Victoria. Their imposing and exceptionally large 30-inch terrestrial globe, similar to this example, the first of its size to be produced in England, was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in Hyde Park London, where it won numerous medals.

From the Catalogue:
The A. Lange & Söhne, 1815 Emil Lange Moonphase, reference 231.035 was introduced in 1999 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Emil Lange’s birthday, son of the founder Ferdinand Lange. Following in his father’s footsteps, he continued his legacy in watchmaking, producing some of the most sophisticated and complicated timepieces available at the time. Produced in a limited series of 150 pieces in platinum and a 250 pieces in pink gold was the brands first wristwatch to feature moonphases.
The present example in platinum and numbered 108/150, is offered in overall very good condition and displays seven applied 18K white gold appliques forming the Big Dipper constellation on the dial, one of the most distinctive asterisms in the universe. The moon phase demonstrates A. Lange & Söhne’s technical skill with a movement, which automatically adjusts twice a day and will only deviate from the orbital position by one day after 1058 years. The reference sold out quickly when first released.

From the Catalogue:
The Lange 1 collection of watches found their beginnings in 1994 when A. Lange & Söhne was relaunched as a brand following their demise during World War II. The firm introduced a collection of four timepieces including the Lange 1, the Arkade, Saxonia and Tourbillon Pour le Mérite. While each watch had their merits it is the Lange 1 timepieces that shone above the others with its unique dial design with off-center hour/minute dial, oversized double date windows and large power reserve. The watch was wearable, dynamic and by its 20th anniversary in 2014 it had become an icon.
With the success of the model, A. Lange & Söhne issued new models and in 2005, they released the Lange 1 Time Zone. A dual-time watch with double barrel mechanism, the watch has a revolving outer world-time ring and AM/PM indication. The present wristwatch features a rare grey dial, which is elegantly set-off from the pink gold case. A masterpiece of horology, the Lange 1 Time Zone defines the philosophy behind the A. Lange & Söhne brand name.

Most impressively, the watch features an gorgeously executed white enamel dial with red Roman XII. This red 12 refers to old pocket watches, as the finest quality was also made with a red 12. The mechanical automatic self-winding ALS caliber L921.7 ""Sax-O-Mat"" movement is made from Glashütte 3/4 plate in German silver, with fausses cotes embellishment. It's constructed with 36 jewels, 307 components, a hand-engraved balance bridge, a shock absorber mechanism, and a straight-line lever escapement.

From the Catalogue:
A. Lange & Söhne Zeitwerk collection is a technical marvel with an aesthetically pleasing design that today is recognizable for its large case and digital jump hour display when it was first released in 2011.
The Lange Zeitwerk Striking Time is a complex technical watch in that the time instantaneously jumps on three discs, which requires a considerable amount of energy, but on the hours and quarters there has to be enough stored energy to actuate the striking train. In typical high precision German engineering, the A. Lange & Söhne solved the issue of the three time discs changing with the use of a constant force escapement and remontoire. For the striking mechanism there is enough stored energy in the striking train that it will chime the time. The Zeitwerk Striking Time indicates the quarters with a high pitch gong found on the right side of the dial, while the hour is indicated by a lower pitch tone, from a gong on the left side of the dial.
The present watch is in excellent overall condition and comes complete with guarantee and presentation box. The Zeitwerk collection of watches represents a pinnacle in precision engineering and horology. The platinum reference 145.025 was made in a limited number of only 100 examples, and this is a rare opportunity for collectors to own a Zeitwerk.

Model Name: 1815 Up/Down
Dimensions: 36mm Diameter
From the Catalogue:
A Lange & Söhne’s 1815 collection is a modern day tribute to founder Ferdinand Adolph Lange who was born in 1815. It honors his exacting standards and precision quality with movements resembling pocket watches made during his time with three-quarter plate movement, blued screws and gold chatons. Lange worked diligently to consistently reproduce movements in a move toward standardization and better timekeeping. In 1879, A. Lange & Söhne was granted patent number 9349 for a device for pocket watches to indicate how much time remained before a watch was fully unwound.
The 1815 Up/Down is reminiscent of chronometers with a power reserve, which were originally featured on chronometers. First released in 1995, the white gold version with blue dial like the present watch is an elegant and classic timepiece. The clean dial with the power reserve and subsidiary seconds at the 8 and 4 positions respectively is clear and easy to read. The watch has a refined style that is quintessential A. Lange & Söhne and wears comfortably on the wrist. In excellent overall condition this is a refined watch that meets the standards of the most discriminating collector.

Model Name: Grosse Langematik Gangreserve
Dimensions: 40.5mm Diameter
From the Catalogue:
The present timepiece represents the union of two of the best renowned names of the German watchmaking market: A. Lange & Söhne and retailer Gerard D Wempe. Wempe was founded in 1878 as a small family shop in Elsfleth but, after connecting with Swiss watchmaker, a proper store was opened in the early 1900s. The success enjoyed was such that already in 1914, Wempe already boasted five branches in Hamburg. The rest, as they say, is history and today Wempe is one of the most respected names in the business.
In 1938, Wempe took over the company ChronometerWerke GmbH, founded in 1905. This model celebrates the centenary of the founding of that company, and it was released in a limited edition of, fittingly, 100 examples. An exercise in supreme elegance and balance, the dial is given a regulator-style (while not being a regulator timepiece) with two subsidiary dials at 12 (power reserve) and at 6 (running seconds). With utmost German restrain, the name of the celebrated retailer does not appear on the dial, rather it is engraved to the back next to the limited edition numbering. The regard A Lange & Söhne had for this limited edition is apparent when considering that even the box is numbered, twice: once on the inside of the top lid, and a second time on the metal frame of the watch cradle.

From the Catalogue:
Following the demise of the Soviet Union in 1989, Walter Lange re-established the brand founded by his great- grandfather in Glashütte in 1990. The first collection, comprised of four watches, was launched in 1994 and immediately rose again to the forefront of haute horology. One of these four watches was the timeless and now iconic Lange One, which this year celebrates its 25th anniversary. We are proud to honor the birth of this iconic model by presenting this fresh-to-the-market, absolutely “New Old Stock”, untouched, Lange One in stainless steel, dating from 1999.
On the brink of Y2K, Cellini Jewelers President Leon Adams received an invoice from A. Lange & Söhne, wherein he accepted delivery of three A. Lange & Söhne watches, including a stainless steel Lange 1 reference 101.026 bearing the case number 117’955, for the price of 8,831 EUR. The year 1999, incidentally, was the first year of the Euro, explaining why the ledger also lists the price in Deutsche marks. For the next 20 years it sat – untouched, undisturbed – in a Cellini inventory drawer. The Lange One in stainless steel was never offered in a catalogue and the manufacture has never confirmed the exact number of stainless steel examples produced. Experts’ estimate that approximately 30 were made in total. Of those thirty, about eight have appeared publicly at auction. Of those appearing at public auction, our research shows that they all bear unique case numbers – they were never re-sold or traded publicly after showing up at auction. The history of this watch is a testament to their long-lasting appeal and Spartan beauty.
A remarkable opportunity for the connoisseur with superb provenance, the watch was never worn or used, nor has a strap ever been fitted to the case.

From the Catalogue:
Introduced into the market in the 1999 Baselworld, the Datograph Flyback was a game-changer in the history of horology and an impressive achievement for a relatively young brand. The flyback function of the Datograph Flyback allows the chronograph to be instantly reset to zero and started again in the midst of an ongoing measurement by simply pushing down the chronograph button. As soon as the button is released, a new timing cycle commences. In addition to the fly-back function, the Datograph Flyback also features a precisely-jumping minute counter.
The present Datograph Flyback is from the second generation, in which Lange re-designed the model to give it a larger case size as well as a power reserve indicator. Additionally, there were some cosmetic alterations, including the removal of roman numerals from the dial and the addition of a power reserve indicator at 6 o'clock, which is referred by collectors as ""Up/Down"". The entire movement can be brilliantly seen through the transparent caseback. Overall, the upgraded design, along with its sublime technical prowess and appealing look, makes the present Datograph Flyback a grail amongst watch enthusiasts.

A brand icon, the Lange 1 was one of the first four timepieces released by the firm when they began manufacturing again in 1994. The watch continued in the tradition of the high-quality exceptional movements first produced in 1845 with Ferdinand Adolph Lange. The technical marvel of the tourbillon is complimented by the artisanal beauty of the enameled dial in black.

Arguably one of the modern classics of 20th century horology, A. Lange & Söhne’s Lange 1 enters its quarter century as sophisticated and contemporary today as it was first released in 1994. The black dial is clear and legible with the patented oversized date windows, and the eccentric hour indication sets the timepiece apart from all the other models. The caliber 901.0 three quarter plate movement provides a 72 hours power reserve, and features a stop second mechanism. The watch is the embodiment of German engineering and precise timekeeping technology.
Presented in wonderful overall condition, this platinum Lange 1 with black dial also known as the ""Darth"" due it is special date version that is all black base as opposed to white base.
